### Project done with assets thanks to Front End Mentor

## Plan:

[*] - Input (enter) ->
[*] - make (create new DOM element) "new ToDo" ->
[] - store new ToDo in browser?

[] - Input - limit of x amount of characters
[] - Theme switcher

## Random ToDo/Ideas:

[*] - change the rendered toDo to Active (from Completed as it is now)
[*] - move the change "itemsLeftCounter" so it triggers when needed
[*] - BUG! with clearing the completed items
